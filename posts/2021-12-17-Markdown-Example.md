This is an example of a blog post written in **_Markdown_**!

Now you can use formatting that:

1. is easier to read and write than HTML
2. may be familiar if you use Tumblr, Reddit, Discord, GitHub, etc.

  <img src="../images/lake.jpg" alt="Concise description of lake photo for screen readers or if image fails to load.">
  <figcaption>You can even use HTML in a Markdown post if you need to!</figcaption>

Here's an example of a table:

| Hello                                                          | World                                                  |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| The dashes above mean that the previous row is a table header. | As long as there are at least 3 dashes in each column! |
| Tables don't have to be evenly spaced in code.                 | But it does make them easier to read!                  |
